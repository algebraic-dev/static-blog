title: The well-known first post
desc: The first post that every developer who has made a blog from scratch writes.

I made this blog using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) (I hate CSS, so it helped me a lot. I just had to memorize some
class patterns to do a lot of things like a Navbar and bang! It's ready to deploy). Markdown files are
stored inside the 'posts' folder, and they're compiled into pages using next-mdx-remote, so I can use
React components inside them.
